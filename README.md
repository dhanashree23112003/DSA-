Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Repository


Welcome to my DSA repository, where I maintain structured and optimized implementations of essential Data Structures & Algorithms to help with coding interviews, competitive programming, and problem-solving. ðŸš€

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

âœ… Arrays & Strings (Sorting, Searching, Sliding Window)

âœ… Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

âœ… Stacks & Queues (Monotonic Stack, Deque, Priority Queue)

âœ… Recursion & Backtracking (Subsets, Permutations, N-Queens)

âœ… Trees & Graphs (BFS, DFS, MST, Shortest Paths)

âœ… Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LCS, LIS, Matrix Chain)

âœ… Greedy Algorithms (Huffman Coding, Activity Selection)

âœ… Bit Manipulation (XOR tricks, Masking)
